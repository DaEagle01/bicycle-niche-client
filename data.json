    "description": "Cannondale is another top bike brand that dates back to the 1970s. While two buddies founded Trek over a glass of beer, Cannonade was birthed over a pickle factory in Connecticut. At first, the company didn’t make bikes but instead produced a bike trailer, accessories and apparel. In 1983, the brand created its first bike, a touring model. It followed up with a racing bike the next year. In 1997, Cannonade made waves at the Tour de France by having members of the Saeco cycling team (who rode the brand’s bike) ride on aluminum frames. According to company legend, the leader of the Saeco team declared Cannondale bikes to be the best. Today, the brand produces a range of bikes, including mountain bikes, road bikes and edibikes. It also has models for children, women and tandem bikes. Generally speaking, Cannondale bikes are at the higher end of the pricing spectrum.

    "description": "Colnago is a bike company based in Italy. The bran dates back to 1952 when Ernesto Colnago founded it in Cambiago. Ernesto Colnago was initially expected to take over his family’s farming business but pursued a career in cycling from a young age. At 13, he was the apprentice at a bike company and eventually opened his shop. The Telegraph has called Colnago the Ferrari of cycling brands, describing it as a bike maker for cycling connoisseurs. The description is apt as many of Colnago’s higher end models are entirely handmade in Italy and feature top quality components. Colnago is not a budget conscious brand by any means. Its most affordable models cost more than $1000 and its top-of-the-line racing bikes go for more than $5000 or $6000."

    "description": "Another Italian bike brand, Bianchi has the distinct honor of being the oldest continually operated cycling company in the world. It dates back to 1885 when 21 year old Eldoardo Bianchi took it upon himself to add a chain to the famous “ordinary” bicycles and to reduce the size of the front wheel. You could say his idea was a success. Over the years, Bianchi was credited with several other developments in this design and function of the bicycle. For example, he created the first ever front brake in 1913.Throughout the 20th century, Bianchi cycles were ridden in several major bicycling tournaments and often won those tournaments. Riding a Bianchi, cyclist Faust Coppi won his first Tour de France in 1949. Felice Gimondi also won the race on a Bianchi in the early 1970s. Today, Bianchi produces city, mountain and racing bikes at a variety of price points, starting at a few hundred dollars. It also makes electric  bikes and models for children."

    "description": "Cervelo is another relatively young bike brand. It got started in 1995 in Canada. The goal of the company is simple: It aims to design the world’s fastest bike. To that end, its probably not a brand that you’re going to check out if you’re new to cycling or if you’re looking for a bike for commuting or occasional use. But if you regularly feel the need for speed on your bike, whether you’re training for an Ironman or the Tour de France or just enjoy a weekend ride, this might be the brand for you. Cervelo has 5 series  of road bike – the C series, Series, Series, S series and T series. None of its bikes are cheap. The lowest end models, the S series start around $5000 while the P series easily cost more than $10,000."
